# Emojify!

Have you ever wanted to make your text messages more expressive? Our emojifier app will help you do that. 
Rather than writing:
>"Congratulations on the promotion! Let's get coffee and talk. Love you!"   

The emojifier can automatically turn this into:
>"Congratulations on the promotion! 👍  Let's get coffee and talk. ☕️ Love you! ❤️"

We will implement a model which inputs a sentence (such as "Let's go see the baseball game tonight!") and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence (⚾️).

### What we will build:
1. We will start with a baseline model (Emojifier-V1) using word embeddings.
2. Then we will build a more sophisticated model (Emojifier-V2) that further incorporates an LSTM.
